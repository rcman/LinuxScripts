Stopping the firewall may not be enough, there is one more command you can use.


sudo systemctl stop firewalld

sudo systemctl disable firewalld

sudo systemctl mask firewalld

Mask the firewalld service (optional but recommended for complete disablement)
For a more complete disablement, mask the service. This prevents it from being started by other services that might pull it in as a dependency. 

This creates a symbolic link from /etc/systemd/system/firewalld.service to /dev/null, effectively making the service unavailable
